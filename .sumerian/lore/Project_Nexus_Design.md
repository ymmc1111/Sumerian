# Project Nexus Design Principles

## 1. Minimalist Aesthetic
- Use ample white space (or dark space in dark mode).
- Prefer subtle borders and shadows over heavy lines.
- Use a monochromatic palette with a single vibrant accent color.

## 2. Jony Ive Principles
- "Simplicity is not just the absence of clutter... it's about bringing order to complexity."
- Every element must have a purpose. If it doesn't add value, remove it.
- Focus on the material and the craft. UI should feel like glass and light.

## 3. Typography
- Use clean, sans-serif fonts (e.g., Inter, SF Pro).
- High contrast hierarchy.
- generous line-height for readability.

## 4. Interaction
- Smooth transitions and micro-animations.
- Hover states should be subtle but clear.
- Feedback should feel instantaneous.
